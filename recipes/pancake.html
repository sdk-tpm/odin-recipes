        <h3>Description</h3>
            <p>These classic fluffy pancakes are the perfect weekend breakfast treat — light, tender, 
            and golden on the outside with soft, pillowy centres that soak up maple syrup beautifully. 
            Made with simple pantry staples, this recipe delivers consistently great results every time, 
            whether you're cooking for one or feeding a hungry family. 
            The secret is in not overmixing the batter (a few small lumps are actually good!) and letting 
            the batter rest for 5–10 minutes before cooking — this helps create the tallest, most tender pancakes.</p>

            <p>You can keep them plain and simple, or easily customise them with blueberries, chocolate chips, sliced bananas, cinnamon, or even a swirl of Nutella. Serve them stacked high with butter, warm maple syrup, fresh fruit, or a dusting of icing sugar for the ultimate comfort-food breakfast.
